I focused on replicating the main features from Crossy Road as I remember it. I used Gemini Pro and cmu_graphics.

Prompts:
Create a detailed crossy road game using Python and cmu_graphics. Include the main features that make crossy road the iconic game that it is. For example, the roads, cars, grid-style movement, four-directional movement, rivers, logs, lilypads, trains, etc. If you have any questions, ask them first.
Theres no collision with the cars
Theres a black bar on the bottom that grows the more you move forward.
Now, can you make the lilypads static with more frequent logs passing through the rivers
it feels like sometimes, certain lanes of rivers don't have logs at all. Also, some logs are overlapping
the lilypads still move you to the right constantly when you stand on them
There is no Check River Logic block
