I focused on replicating the main features from Crossy Road as I remember it. I used Gemini Pro and cmu_graphics.

Prompts:
1. Create a detailed crossy road game using Python and cmu_graphics. Include the main features that make crossy road the iconic game that it is. For example, the roads, cars, grid-style movement, four-directional movement, rivers, logs, lilypads, trains, etc. If you have any questions, ask them first.
2. Theres no collision with the cars
3. Theres a black bar on the bottom that grows the more you move forward.
4. Now, can you make the lilypads static with more frequent logs passing through the rivers
5. it feels like sometimes, certain lanes of rivers don't have logs at all. Also, some logs are overlapping
6. the lilypads still move you to the right constantly when you stand on them
7. There is no Check River Logic block
8. Movement on the logs is buggy, the game doesnt seem to update the backend location constantly, only when pressing a button
9. Exception: Use our rounded(n) instead of Python 3's round(n)
  Python 3's round(n) does not work as one might expect!
  If you still want Python 3's round, use pythonRound
10. Could you redo the grid-system? The game seems to be running on a coordinate system right now, but it would be better to have everything occupy blocks of space
***May have lost a lot of time here, as I was asking to basically completely rechange the code to fit a grid system. This was around 30 mins.
11. The lilypads and logs have issues with the character moving again
12. No i meant the issue was that when the character stands on a log or lilypad, they move constantly too fast (outpaces log, moves on static lilypad)
13. side-to-side movement on the logs is still buggy, it should use the log as a reference point and move accordingly, but the character moves inconsistently due to the changing position of the log
14. Now can you improve the graphics? specifically for the roads, cars, and the grass(make the grass alternating chess-board style squares)
15. An error occurred. Here is the stack trace:
  "/Users/nickopenguin500/Documents/GitHub/15113-hw2-crossy-road/crossyRoad.py", line 217:
        drawRect(c * app.gridSize, screenY, app.gridSize, app.gridSize, fill=gColor)
Exception: TypeError: Rect.fill should be a color, and #7CFC00 is not a legal color name
16. Can you make the score label in the top left a different color to stand out more from the game? also display the score when dying. Also keep track of the top score and also show that when dying
17. Do you have any suggestions on how to improve this game
18. where in onkeypress do i paste #3
19. snatched by the eagle is printing to the console instead of showing ingame
20. the snatched by the eagle text is bigger than the box
