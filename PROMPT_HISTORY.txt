I focused on replicating the main features from Crossy Road as I remember it. I used Gemini Pro and cmu_graphics.

Prompts:
1. Create a detailed crossy road game using Python and cmu_graphics. Include the main features that make crossy road the iconic game that it is. For example, the roads, cars, grid-style movement, four-directional movement, rivers, logs, lilypads, trains, etc. If you have any questions, ask them first.
2. Theres no collision with the cars
3. Theres a black bar on the bottom that grows the more you move forward.
4. Now, can you make the lilypads static with more frequent logs passing through the rivers
5. it feels like sometimes, certain lanes of rivers don't have logs at all. Also, some logs are overlapping
6. the lilypads still move you to the right constantly when you stand on them
7. There is no Check River Logic block
8. Movement on the logs is buggy, the game doesnt seem to update the backend location constantly, only when pressing a button
9. Exception: Use our rounded(n) instead of Python 3's round(n)
  Python 3's round(n) does not work as one might expect!
  If you still want Python 3's round, use pythonRound
10.
